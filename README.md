# Coding Interview Problems

## About
Welcome to our repo! These files are maintained by **Patrick Anderson** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Panderson14), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/panderson2014)) and **Richard Dizon** ([GitHub](https://github.com/rcdizon), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcdizon)), two current undergraduate students from the University of Virginia on our journey to becoming coding interview masters.

For months we've been honing our interview skills by interviewing each other in person, over the phone, and over Google Hangouts (similar to real-life interview situations) taking on problems pulled from *Cracking the Coding Interview*, *Programming Interviews Exposed* and *Elements of Programming Interviews* and decided to start putting our personal solutions online in this repo.

Many of these solutions have not been optimized as these are our **_actual, in-person responses_** to the questions. In fact, one might say that our code is quite messy and some of these may not even be fully correct but we wanted to create this repo as a way to track our progression across our interview prep experience. This makes it easy for us to go back to any of our previous problems in the future and try to improve our responses once we've gotten better at interviewing. The same can be said for any student visitors on our repo: it may be helpful for you to look through our old code and think of how you might potentially respond to them more effectively!

For any of our future interviewers out there who may be looking through our code right now, we'll try our best to honorably let you know whether or not we've seen your problem as we *have* done quite a bit of practice on these problems as well as others that we've previously tackled before the creation of this repo.
